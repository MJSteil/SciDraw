## Warning

This is currently a "stub" repository, not yet meant to be branched or used for
active development.  You should not attempt to edit the auto-generated .m files
under this repository.  The current definitive source files are the .nb files
found in the standard distribution.  The documentation in these .nb files will
be extracted as comments to the .m files and the .m files will be heavily
reformatted.  This should be done before any attempt is made to edit the .m
files.
